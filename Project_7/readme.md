For the given GoogLeNet architecture https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4842.pdf, I followed the below formula in order to calculate the receprive field. The paper states that the final receptive field is 224x224, however I have got different results. I tried considering both architecture table and diagram, however the calculated receptive field did not match the size as mentioned in the paper. The detailed calculation for the receptive field is mentioned in a sheet, named "RF Calculation" added in the same folder. If I am doing anything wrong, kindly share the feedback and I will work on it again.
