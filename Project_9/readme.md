# Assignment:

 Take your 6A Code (your optimized version, not the base version with Dense layer), and learn how to integrate gradCAM with your code. Learn more about [gradCAM here](https://www.hackevolve.com/where-cnn-is-looking-grad-cam/).

As proof of integration, test 4 images (remember the image ids or names) from your network and show the visualization like this:

This is the first part of the assignment. 

Train your 6A model again, but this time add CutOut. [Use this link](https://github.com/yu4u/cutout-random-erasing) for reference. 

Show the same 4 images again with gradCAM's result.
